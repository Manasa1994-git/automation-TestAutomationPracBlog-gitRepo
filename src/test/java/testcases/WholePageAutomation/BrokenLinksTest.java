/*
1)Finding All Links:
2)HTTP HEAD Requests to Each Link:
3)Logging Results:If the response code is 400 or above, it logs as a broken link with error level.

If the response code is below 400 (e.g., 200 OK), it logs as a valid link.

If a linkâ€™s href is empty or malformed, it skips with a warning.
4)The log file (your configured log4j output) 
will contain the results for all links checked, showing 
which links were valid and which were broken.
