 <!-- 
	1. So here, parallel="methods" means each @Test method inside the class runs simultaneously in separate threads.
	
	2.The possible values for parallel are:

tests — runs <test> tags in parallel (multiple test blocks)

classes — runs different test classes in parallel

methods — runs individual test methods in parallel (inside your classes)

instances — runs different instances of test classes in parallel (less common)

3.thread-count="3"

This limits the maximum number of threads TestNG can create at the same time to 3.

So at most, 3 test methods will run simultaneously, even if there are more than 3 test methods.
